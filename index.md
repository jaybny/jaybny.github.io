At my core, I'm a dedicated husband and father. Professionally, I'm a GenX software developer with an unwavering passion for the intricacies of financial markets. When I'm not engrossed in code or exploring the depths of Bitcoin, I'm strategizing my next fantasy football move.

## From Brooklyn to Bitcoin: Jay Berg's Odyssey

Growing up in Brooklyn, NY, my interest in finance was sparked by my father, Milton Berg, and his uncanny prediction of the Black Monday crash in '87. This event propelled me to code my own trading system during my formative years, ushering me into the world of electronic trading alongside early innovators like Datek Securities.

In '97, Bloomberg was my proving ground. Immersed in a dynamic environment filled with astute traders, I deepened my understanding of trading, coding, and the relentless pursuit of market advantages. Initially, I believed math held the keys to the market, but soon grasped that it was merely a piece of a larger puzzle.

My journey led me to Chicago, the heartland of high-frequency trading. The industry was rapidly transitioning from the tangible energy of trading floors to the digital frontier. Finally, at Fortress Investment Group, I witnessed and participated in the frenetic evolution of trading: from the primal race for speed to the nuanced chase for Alpha.

Enter Bitcoin. After poring over the whitepaper, I recognized its potential immediacy. This revelation spurred me to author the "Satoshi Fantasy" [white paper](satoshifantasy) in 2014, and to [code](https://github.com/protoblock/protoblock) an innovative blockchain: [FantasyBit](https://fantasybit.com/). Its aim? To transform fantasy football skills into a digital asset, and leverage it a decentralized fantasy futures exchange. 

Despite the promise, challenges arose, like front-running. Yet, adversity fosters innovation. I conceptualized a solution, earned a patent, and in 2021, unveiled the [Sidepit white paper](https://jaybny.com/sidepit/). Currently, I'm in the midst of bringing the Sidepit exchange to life, continuing my relentless pursuit of financial innovation.

On a personal note, a moment of pride: I was the first to share the Bitcoin ticker symbol on Twitter: [`$BTCUSD`](https://twitter.com/jaybny/status/233992704994971648). 
As Sidepit becomes into reality, I find myself at a thrilling juncture, merging decades of financial acumen with the revolutionary promise of decentralized technology.
