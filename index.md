A dedicated husband and father first, I'm a GenX software developer with a passion for understanding the intricacies of financial markets. When I'm not diving deep into code or Bitcoin, you'll find me strategizing my next move in fantasy football.


## From Brooklyn to Bitcoin and Beyond: Jay Berg's Journey

Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, my journey through the intricate tapestry of financial markets began when I saw my father, Milton Berg, predict the Black Monday crash of 1987. That event drove my 12-year-old self to code my first automated trading system, setting the stage for my deep dive into electronic trading with trailblazers like Datek Securities.

By '96, at Bloomberg, I was amidst a talented mix of traders, sharpening my coding skills and delving into the intricacies of quant models. While I dreamt of beating the market, it became evident that pure math, despite its might, wasn't the silver bullet to alpha.

As I ventured to Chicago, I was swept into the tumultuous world of high-frequency trading, transitioning from the vibrant energy of trading floors to the precision of digital platforms. My tenure at Fortress Investment Group was a roller-coaster of emotions, from harnessing the raw power of speed for trading advantages to chasing the elusive Alpha.

Then came Bitcoin, a revelation after just one glance at its white paper. It wasn't long before I penned the "Satoshi Fantasy" white paper and undertook the ambitious task of coding an entirely new blockchain, "Fantasybit". Crafted in C++, Fantasybit wasn't just another blockchainâ€”it was a novel idea that tokenized fantasy football skill and paved the way for a fantasy football futures exchange.

However, challenges arose. Confronted with issues like front-running, I innovated a solution, secured the patent, and in 2021, articulated this vision in the Sidepit white paper. Now, as I stand on the brink of launching the Sidepit exchange, I'm merging decades of financial insights, groundbreaking technological advancements, and the pioneering spirit of decentralized technology.

Join me on this adventure, where the past empowers the future.
