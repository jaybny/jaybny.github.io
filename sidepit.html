<p>Summary: "Sidepit: Fair Price Discovery via Decentralized Exchange" discusses challenges in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and proposes a solution for fair price discovery. DEXs aim to replicate market processes on a blockchain, but issues like front-running persist due to blockchain's asynchronous nature.</p>

<p>The proposed solution, called "Sidepit," involves a network of exchange nodes hosting matching engines and order books. Consensus is reached through a multi-step process, neutralizing the advantage of high-frequency trading, eliminating the need for front-running, and preventing unfair strategies.</p>

<p>The paper emphasizes designing DEXs with fair price discovery in mind, using distributed mechanism design and game theory to align incentives for participants and achieve the exchange's intended goals.</p>
