At my core, I'm a dedicated husband and father. Professionally, I'm a GenX software developer with a strong passion for  financial markets. When I'm not diving into code or exploring the intricacies of Bitcoin, I'm planning my next fantasy football move.

## From Brooklyn to Bitcoin: Jay Berg's Odyssey
Growing up in Brooklyn, NY, my interest in finance was sparked by my father, Milton Berg, who impressively predicted the '87 Black Monday crash. This event inspired me to create my own trading system during my early years, introducing me to electronic trading alongside pioneers like Datek Securities.

In '97, I honed my skills at Bloomberg. Immersed in a dynamic environment with sharp traders, I deepened my understanding of trading, coding, and the constant pursuit of market advantages. While I initially thought math was the key to trading, I realized it's just one part of the puzzle.

My path led me to Chicago, the epicenter of high-frequency trading. It was in this bustling city that I met my now wife. The trading industry was rapidly shifting from traditional trading floors to the digital arms race. Finally, at Fortress Investment Group, I experienced the fast-paced evolution of trading: from speed to nuanced Alpha strategies.

Enter Bitcoin. After reading the whitepaper, I was all in immediately. This spurred me to write the "Satoshi Fantasy" [white paper](satoshifantasy) in 2014, and [code](https://github.com/protoblock/protoblock) an innovative blockchain: [FantasyBit](https://fantasybit.com/). Its goal? Transforming fantasy football skills into a digital asset and using it in a decentralized fantasy futures exchange.

Despite the promise, challenges arose, like front-running. I persevered, conceived a solution, secured a patent, and in 2021, introduced the [Sidepit white paper.](https://jaybny.com/sidepit/) Currently, I'm working on making the Sidepit bitcoin exchange a reality, continuing my pursuit of financial innovation.

On a personal note, a moment of pride: I was the first to share the Bitcoin ticker symbol on Twitter: $BTCUSD. As Sidepit comes to life, I'm excited to merge my financial experience with the promise of decentralized technology.
